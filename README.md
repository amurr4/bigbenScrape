### Overview:
Welcome to my Data Science Portfolio! This repository showcases my development of a webscraper to download career statistics for my favorite quarterback: Ben Roethlisberger (Big Ben).

### Description:
The goal of this project is to perform web-scraping techniques to collect comprehensive data on Ben Roethlisberger, a seasoned NFL quarterback, and analyze his game trends over his 17-year career. The aim is to gather detailed statistics that encapsulate various aspects of his performance, including passing, rushing, fumbles, defense, receiving, and punting. Using BeatifulSoup, I can easily parse HTML tags and tables and create CSV files containing Big Ben's career statistics.

### Technologies Used:
Python (BeautifulSoup, pandas)
VS code

### Data:
NFL.com

### Expected Outcomes:
A comprehensive dataset containing detailed statistical information on Ben Roethlisberger's NFL career in CSV format, ready for data preprocessing and later explorartory data analysis.
